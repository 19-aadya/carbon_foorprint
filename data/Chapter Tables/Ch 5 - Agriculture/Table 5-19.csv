"Note: Due to lack of data, uncertainties in PRP manure N production, other organic fertilizer amendments, and biosolids (i.e., treated sewage sludge) amendments to soils are currently treated as certain; these sources of uncertainty will be included in future Inventory reports, which is a standard data splicing method for estimating emissions at the end of a time series (IPCC 2006).",,,,,,
