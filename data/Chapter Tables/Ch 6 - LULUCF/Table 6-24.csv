"Notes: Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. Parentheses indicate net uptake. Forest ecosystem C stock changes from land conversion in Alaska are currently included in the Forest Land Remaining Forest Land section because there is insufficient data to separate the changes at this time. Forest ecosystem C stock changes from land conversion do not include U.S. Territories because managed forest land in U.S. Territories is not currently included in Section 6.1 Representation of the U.S. Land Base. The forest ecosystem C stock changes from land conversion do not include Hawaii because there is insufficient NFI data to support inclusion at this time. See Annex 3.13, Table A-217 for annual differences between the forest area reported in Section 6.1 Representation of the U.S. Land Base and Section 6.3 Land Converted to Forest Land. Since area estimates for some land use categories were not updated in the Land Representation in the current Inventory there are differences in the area estimates reported in this section and those reported in Section 6.1 Representation of the U.S. Land Base. The forest ecosystem C stock changes from land conversion do not include trees on non-forest land (e.g., agroforestry systems and settlement areas—see Section 6.10 Settlements Remaining Settlements for estimates of C stock change from settlement trees). It is not possible to separate emissions from drained organic soils between Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and Land Converted to Forest Land so estimates for all organic soils are included in Table 6?8 and Table 6?9 of the Forest Land Remaining Forest Land section of the Inventory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
