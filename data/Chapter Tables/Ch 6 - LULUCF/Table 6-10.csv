"Notes: Forest area and C stock estimates include all Forest Land Remaining Forest Land in the conterminous 48 states and Alaska. Forest ecosystem C stocks do not include forest stocks in U.S. Territories because managed forest land for U.S. Territories is not currently included in Section 6.1 Representation of the U.S. Land Base. The forest ecosystem C stocks do not include Hawaii because there is not sufficient NFI data to support inclusion at this time. However, managed forest land area for Hawaii is included in Section 6.1 Representation of the U.S. Land Base so there are small differences in the forest land area estimates in this Section and Section 6.1. See Annex 3.13, Table A-213 for annual differences between the forest area reported in Section 6.1 Representation of the U.S. Land Base and Section 6.2 Forest Land Remaining Forest Land. The forest ecosystem C stocks do not include trees on non-forest land (e.g., agroforestry systems and settlement areas—see Section 6.10 Settlements Remaining Settlements for estimates of C stock change from settlement trees). Forest ecosystem C stocks on managed forest land in Alaska were compiled using the gain-loss method as described in Annex 3.13. Harvested wood product stocks include exports, even if the logs are processed in other countries, and exclude imports. Harvested wood estimates are based on results from annual surveys and models. Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. Population estimates compiled using FIA data are assumed to represent stocks as of January 1 of the inventory year. Flux is the net annual change in stock. Thus, an estimate of flux for 2020 requires estimates of C stocks for 2020 and 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
