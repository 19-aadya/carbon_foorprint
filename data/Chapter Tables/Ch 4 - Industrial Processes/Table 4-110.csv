"a Regression coefficient for emissions is calculated utilizing transmission miles as the explanatory variable and emissions as the response variable. The equation utilizes a constant intercept of zero. When calculating the regression coefficient, outliers are also removed from the analysis when the standard residual for that reporter exceeds the value 3.0. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
