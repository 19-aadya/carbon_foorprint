Notes: Differences smaller than the 1 s.d. uncertainty on the annual NOAA-based estimates are not shown. Differences greater than 2 s.d. shown in bold font. Uncertainties associated with the Vintaging model have not been estimated by compound and year so are not included and could imply fewer differences than shown in this table.  ,,,,
