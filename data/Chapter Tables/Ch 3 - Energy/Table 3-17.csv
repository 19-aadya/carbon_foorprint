,"b The low and high estimates for total emissions were calculated separately through simulations and, hence, the low and high emission estimates for the sub-source categories do not sum to total emissions.",,,,,
,"c Geothermal emissions added for reporting purposes, but an uncertainty analysis was not performed for CO2 emissions from geothermal production.",,,,,
