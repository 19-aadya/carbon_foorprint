"a In 2011, FHWA changed its methods for estimating vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and related data. These methodological changes included how vehicles are classified, moving from a system based on body-type to one that is based on wheelbase. These changes were first incorporated for the 1990 through 2010 Inventory and apply to the 2007 through 2020 time period. This resulted in large changes in VMT and fuel consumption data by vehicle class, thus leading to a shift in emissions among on-road vehicle classes. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b Gasoline and diesel highway vehicle fuel consumption estimates are based on data from FHWA Highway Statistics Table MF-27 and VM-1 (FHWA 1996 through 2021). Data from Table VM-1 is used to estimate the share of consumption between each on-road vehicle class. These fuel consumption estimates are combined with estimates of fuel shares by vehicle type from DOE’s TEDB Annex Tables A.1 through A.6 (DOE 1993 through 2021). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

e Note that large year over year fluctuations in emission estimates partially reflect nature of data collection for these sources.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"j Transportation sector natural gas and LPG consumption are based on data from EIA (2021b). Prior to the 1990 to 2015 Inventory, data from DOE TEDB were used to estimate each vehicle class’s share of the total natural gas and LPG consumption. Since TEDB does not include estimates for natural gas use by medium and heavy-duty trucks or LPG use by passenger cars, EIA Alternative Fuel Vehicle Data (Browning 2017) is now used to determine each vehicle class’s share of the total natural gas and LPG consumption. These changes were first incorporated in the 1990 to 2016 Inventory and apply to the 1990 to 2020 time period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
k Includes emissions from rail electricity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"l Electricity consumption by passenger cars, light-duty trucks (SUVs), and buses is based on plug-in electric vehicle sales and engine efficiency data, as outlined in Browning (2018a). In prior Inventory years, CO2 emissions from electric vehicle charging were allocated to the residential and commercial sectors. They are now allocated to the transportation sector. These changes apply to the 2010 through 2020 time period. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Notes: This table does not include emissions from non-transportation mobile sources, such as agricultural equipment and construction/mining equipment; it also does not include emissions associated with electricity consumption by pipelines or lubricants used in transportation. In addition, this table does not include CO2 emissions from U.S. Territories, since these are covered in a separate chapter of the Inventory. Totals may not sum due to independent rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
