,a The GWPs presented here are the ones most consistent with the methodology used in the AR4 report. ,,,,,,,
,b The GWP values presented here from the AR5 report include climate-carbon feedbacks for the non-CO2 gases in order to be consistent with the approach used in calculating the CO2 lifetime. ,,,,,,,
,"c The 100-year GWPs from AR6 are prepublication values based on the Working Group 1 report published in August 2021. As the report is finalized for full publication, in the final editing process, these values may be updated in corrigenda and EPA will update this analysis to reflect the final values.",,,,,,,
,d The GWP of CH4 includes the direct effects and those indirect effects due to the production of tropospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapor. Including the indirect effect due to the production of CO2 resulting from methane oxidation would lead to an increase in AR5 methane GWP values by 2 for fossil methane and is not shown in this table.,,,,,,,
