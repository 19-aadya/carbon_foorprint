,"a The atmospheric CO2 concentration is the 2020 annual average at the Mauna Loa, HI station (NOAA/ESRL 2021a). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration, computed using an average of sampling sites across the world, was 412 ppm in 2019.",,,,,
,b The values presented are global 2020 annual average mole fractions (NOAA/ESRL 2021b).,,,,,
,c The values presented are global 2020 annual average mole fractions (NOAA/ESRL 2021c).,,,,,
,d The values presented are global 2020 annual average mole fractions (NOAA/ESRL 2021d).,,,,,
,e The 2019 CF4 global mean atmospheric concentration is from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (IPCC 2021).,,,,,
,"f The rate of concentration change for CO2 is an average of the rates from 2007 through 2020 and has fluctuated between 1.5 to 3.0 ppm per year over this period (NOAA/ESRL 2021a). The rate of concentration change for CH4, N2O, and SF6, is the average rate of change between 2007 and 2020 (NOAA/ESRL 2021b; NOAA/ESRL 2021c; NOAA/ESRL 2021d). The rate of concentration change for CF4 is the average rate of change between 2011 and 2019 (IPCC 2021).",,,,,
,"g The growth rate for atmospheric CH4 decreased from over 10 ppb/year in the 1980s to nearly zero in the early 2000s; recently, the growth rate has been about 7.91 ppb/year (NOAA/ESRL 2021b).",,,,,
,"h For a given amount of CO2 emitted, some fraction of the atmospheric increase in concentration is quickly absorbed by the oceans and terrestrial vegetation, some fraction of the atmospheric increase will only slowly decrease over a number of years, and a small portion of the increase will remain for many centuries or more.",,,,,
,i This lifetime has been defined as an “adjustment time” that takes into account the indirect effect of the gas on its own residence time.,,,,,
,"j The lifetime for SF6 was revised from 3,200 years to about 1,000 years based on recent studies (IPCC 2021).",,,,,
,"Source: Pre-industrial atmospheric concentrations and atmospheric lifetimes for CH4, N2O, SF6, and CF4 are from IPCC (2021).  ",,,,,
