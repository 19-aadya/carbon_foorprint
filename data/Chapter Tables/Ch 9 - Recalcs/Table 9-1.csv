"c LULUCF emissions of CH4 and N2O are reported separately from gross emissions totals in Table 9-2. LULUCF emissions include the CH4 and N2O emissions reported for Peatlands Remaining Peatlands, Forest Fires, Drained Organic Soils, Grassland Fires, and Coastal Wetlands Remaining Coastal Wetlands; Land Converted to Coastal Wetlands; Land Remaining Flooded Land; Land Converted to Flooded Land; and N2O emissions from Forest Soils and Settlement Soils.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
