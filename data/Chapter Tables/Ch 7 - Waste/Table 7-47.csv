,"a The count of operational facilities was visually estimated from Figure 5 in EPA (2021), which presents the count of the first year of digester operation. The number of operational facilities by year is assumed to be the cumulative total from the prior year. This method assumes all facilities are operating from 1990, or their first year of operation, to 2020. The number of facilities operating between 2015 to 2018 are equal to the number of facilities surveyed by EPA (EPA 2018, 2019, and 2021). The number of facilities operating in 2019 and 2020 are assumed to be the same as the last survey report data year, i.e., 2018 as reported in EPA (2021). These assumptions are further discussed in the Methodology and Time-Series Consistency section.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
