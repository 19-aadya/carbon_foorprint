"a For years 1990 to 2004, the Inventory methodology for MSW landfills uses the first order decay methodology. A methodological change occurs in year 2005. For years 2005 to 2020, directly reported net CH4 emissions from the GHGRP data plus a scale-up factor are used to account for emissions from landfill facilities that are not subject to the GHGRP. More details on the scale-up factor and how it was developed can be found in Annex 3.14. These data incorporate CH4 recovered and oxidized for MSW landfills. As such, CH4 generation, CH4 oxidation, and CH4 recovery are not calculated separately and totaled to net CH4 emissions. See the Methodology and Time-Series Consistency section of this chapter for more information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b Methane recovery is not calculated for industrial landfills because this is not a common practice in the United States. Only 1 landfill of 169 that report to Subpart TT (Industrial Waste Landfills) of the GHGRP had an active gas collection and control system during the year 2020 (EPA 2021a).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
