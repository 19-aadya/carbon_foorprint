,a The amount of waste digested primarily consists of food waste. The amount processed for all years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,is likely an underestimate because the estimates were developed from survey data provided by,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"operating facilities for 2015 to 2018 (EPA 2018; EPA 2019; EPA 2021). Facilities that did not respond to the EPA surveys are not included and all years except 2015 to 2018 are estimated using assumptions regarding the number of operating facilities and the weighted average of waste digested. Additionally, the liquid portion of the waste digested in 2015 and 2016 are not included due to limited information on the specific waste types to perform the unit conversion to kt. EPA converted liquid waste to tons for 2018 and 2019 using a conversion factor of 3.8 pounds per gallon (EPA 2021). The weighted average of waste digested in 2015 and 2016 (as reported in EPA 2018 and 2019) is used as the average for 1990 to 2014, and the average waste digested as reported in EPA (2021) is used as a proxy for years 2019 to 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
