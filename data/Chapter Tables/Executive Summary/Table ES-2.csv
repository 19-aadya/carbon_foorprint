"a LULUCF emissions of CH4 and N2O are reported separately from gross emissions totals. LULUCF emissions include the CH4 and N2O emissions reported for Peatlands Remaining Peatlands, Forest Fires, Drained Organic Soils, Grassland Fires, and Coastal Wetlands Remaining Coastal Wetlands; CH4 emissions from Land Converted to Coastal Wetlands, Flooded Land Remaining Flooded Land, and Land Converted to Flooded Land; and N2O emissions from Forest Soils and Settlement Soils.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b LULUCF Carbon Stock Change is the net C stock change from the following categories: Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, Land Converted to Forest Land, Cropland Remaining Cropland, Land Converted to Cropland, Grassland Remaining Grassland, Land Converted to Grassland, Wetlands Remaining Wetlands, Land Converted to Wetlands, Settlements Remaining Settlements, and Land Converted to Settlements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c The LULUCF Sector Net Total is the net sum of all LULUCF CH4 and N2O emissions to the atmosphere plus net C stock changes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes: Total emissions presented without LULUCF. Net emissions presented with LULUCF. Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. Parentheses indicate negative values or sequestration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
